      Is a definition of ObjectType for our Link class. First (String) argument defines the name in the schema.
      If you want it could differ from name of case class.
      In fields you have to define all those fields/functions you want to expose.
      Every field has to contain a resolve function which tells Sangria how to retrieve data for this field.
      As you can see there is also an explicitly defined type for that field.
      Manual mapping could be boring in cases where you have to map many case classes.
      To avoid boilerplate code you can use the provided macro
